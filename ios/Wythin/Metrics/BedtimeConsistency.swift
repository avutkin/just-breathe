///
/// **This replaced the Sleep Regularity Index, and the reason is the device.**
/// SRI compares every minute of the day against the same minute 24 h earlier
/// and scores the agreement. That makes it a superb measure — it is the one
/// sleep number that beat duration head-to-head in 60,977 UK Biobank
/// participants — and a measure of *daily wear* just as much as of the sleeper.
/// A night the strap was not worn has no sleep in it, so it reads as a night
/// spent entirely awake, and every minute of it disagrees with the night
/// before. On a chest strap somebody puts on for a study of a few nights rather
/// than every night of their life, SRI does not report an irregular sleeper. It
/// reports an intermittent wearer, in a number indistinguishable from the
/// first.
///
/// Bedtime consistency asks the question intermittent wear can answer: of the
/// nights we did record, how close together was the time you fell asleep? A gap
/// between two nights costs nothing, because each night contributes one instant
/// and says nothing about the days around it. Three nights across three weeks
/// are as answerable as three in a row.
///
/// Circular statistics throughout, because clock times wrap. 23:50 and 00:10
/// are twenty minutes apart, and any measure that reports them as twenty-three
/// hours and forty is broken for exactly the people who go to bed near
/// midnight — which is most of them.
